if you want to create venv in python 
  go to the dir whare you want and use the command
  python3 -m venv ./venv
if you want to activate it 
  you can use 
  source ./venv/bin/activate
if you want to deactivate it 
  you can use
  deactivate 
now we need to install django in our venv
  pip install django
start your project
  django-admin startproject (project_name)
** manage.py we never touch this file beacause we will use it instead of django-admin
you need to init a git repo
  git init 
you can create your .gitignore file by using 'gitignore.io'
  and then
  git add . && git commit -m 'initial commit'
now run our srever
  python manage.py runserver
our first app in this project is pages app 
** this for any static page
   python manage.py startapp pages
after creating the static folder and all the required pathes in the setting.py file
** you need to run the 
   python manage.py collectstatic
** and the static file to .gitignore 
the linking in django 
   {% url 'index' %}
** the editing of highlight pages
   {% if '/' == request.path %}
                  class="nav-item active mr-3"
             {% else %}
                  class="nav-item mr-3" 
             {%endif%}
** you should go and see settings.py to see DATABASE section for new edit for postgresql database
